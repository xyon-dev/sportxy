rosters with same total salary need to be compared 
to make sure it isn't a duplicate roster with payers 
in a different order
#filter for salary
#compare new array values. WR is the only position needing comparison
#WR1 shouldnt be the same, so 2,3,flex need to be compared

2.
send final roster list to backend or webworker
