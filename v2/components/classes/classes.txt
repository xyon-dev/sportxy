Class: components with event handlers and/or methods 
  constructor (data...)
  -- methods()
  template()
    a template variable is held internally. data 
    is applied and the template + data is returned
    ex: 
      const component = new Class(params)
      const loop = ContentLoop(data, component.temp())
      element.innerHTML = loop
  register()
    events: add event listener to components of Class type  
    good for adding numerous components to the same page
    where all need a event listener attached
